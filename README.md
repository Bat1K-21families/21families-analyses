# 21families: analyses, code, and contributors
**Scripts, code, and contact information of the core team who contributed to the analyses in the flagship paper of the Bat1K project phase 1 (21 families).**<br>
We did not develop new software for this study; thus, we provide example commands for analyses or provide links to other sources employed.
